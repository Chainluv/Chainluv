👋Hey there! Chainluv here. Just a silly internet name that has nothing to do with anything. Well actually, I came up with it after I went down the bitcoin rabbit hole.
It's a play on words regarding my 💞️love for blockchain technology, a technology that has changed my life in many ways. I've always been interested in Web Development,
but the explosion of blockchain has inspired me to quit 👀speculating and get in on the action. I am currently studying Web Development, starting all the way from 🌱HTML.
Yea, I said it. I'm a complete noob. I am fascinated by the amout of free education out there, and I would be a fool not to take advantage of it. I welcome any and all 
resources that someone might have! My intended path is to learn the necessary skills to become a remote Front End Web Developer. Knowing me, I won't stop there. I've studied
graphic design, animation, and videography. When it's all said and done, I'd like to be designing/developing mobile apps. I also want to learn some 3d modeling, to create
some wearables for the metaverse. Am I doing to much? Am I even on the right path? ✨Only time will tell. thats enough ranting. Happy coding people!✨
