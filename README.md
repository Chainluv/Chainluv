Hey there! Chainluv here. Just a silly internet name that has nothing to do with anything. Well actually, I came up with it after I went down the bitcoin rabbit hole.
It's a play on words regarding my love for blockchain technology, a technology that has changed my life in many ways. I've always been interested in Web Development,
but the explosion of blockchain has inspired me to quit speculating and get in on the action. I am currently studying Web Development, starting all the way from HTML.
Yea, I said it. I'm a complete noob. I am fascinated by the amout of free education out there, and I would be a fool not to take advantage of it. I welcome any and all 
resources that someone might have! My intended path is to learn the necessary skills to become a remote Front End Web Developer. Knowing me, I won't stop there. I've studied
graphic design, animation, and videography. When it's all said and done, I'd like to be designing/developing mobile apps. I also want to learn some 3d modeling, to create
some wearables for the metaverse. Am I doing to much? Am I even on the right path? Only time will tell. thats enough ranting. Happy coding people!
